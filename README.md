# Project 4 — Video
For this project, you’ll create a 120- to 150-second music video using Premiere Pro, then upload it to your MMP server account. The video footage must be a combination of your own footage (at *least* 50%) plus footage from [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/audio) (at *most* 50%).

You may use audio regardless of license: copyright, Creative Commons, or your own. These are the guidelines.

## Audio Guidelines

### Copyright
You may use copywritten music for this project, but leaving it up on the MMP server will constitute a breach of copyright. You will have to take the video down once you’ve received a grade for the project, and you’d be defeating the author’s copyright should you use it in your portfolio.

### Creative Commons
There are various licenses under the Creative Commons rubric. We’ll discuss in class so you understand the options.

### Public Domain
If the work is in the public domain, then you’re free to use the work in your portfolio and leave it on the MMP servers.

### Your Own
You, of course, own the copyright to your work. Thus, it’s up to you whether you want to make it a portfolio piece and leave it on the MMP servers.

## Directions
1. Create a folder for your project called `project-4`.
2. Export your video using the H.264 codec. Go to `File` | `Export` | `Media…`, or simply use the `⌘ + M` keyboard shortcut.
3. Name the exported file using lowercase characters and dashes to delimit words. For example, if you created a project called `the-shape-of-water`, then you’d name the file `the-shape-of-water.mp4`.
4. Place the movie file in your `project-4` folder.
5. Create an `index.html` file, add your full name, the name of the project, and a link to the movie using the `video` element. Add it to your `project-4` folder.
6. Using FileZilla, upload the `project-4` folder to your MMP server account, under the `mmp-100` folder you created for project 3. The URL for the user Guillermo del Toro, for example, would be [`http://mmp.bmcc.cuny.edu/guillermo.del.toro/spring-2018/mmp-100/project-4/`](http://mmp.bmcc.cuny.edu/guillermo.del.toro/spring-2018/mmp-100/project-4/).
7. Edit this `README.md` file, according to the **Submission** directions below, by adding a link to your project and including a description.
